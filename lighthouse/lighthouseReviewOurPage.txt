For the performance:
- One of the thing we could optimize first is the quantity of css files we have, having one css page and less javascripts files can reduce network's latency.
- We could also try to optimize the critical rendering path to render the page faster by optimizing the code in our html,css and js.
- Another way is rendering the necessary assets first and delaying the rest, making priorities for the render.
- It goes faster to fetch certain things from a cache than a server directly. This could also improve performances.
- Optimizing image size can also help by a lot, image size is one of the heaviest things and the format of those matters.
- Reduce the number of http requests.
- Minify your CSS and JavaScript files by removing unnecessary characters, spaces, and comments.
- For tbt we could break long task in smaller parts to make them more manageable 
- CLS on the website looks great.

Accessibility:

- Make the button have an accessible name because it is called buttons, people relying on screen readers will only see button and not what the button is meant to do.
-Change the links so it represent better the content displaying on screen.

Best Practices: 
-Overall pretty good
- There are a few browser errors that could be fixed written in the console but nothing too disruptive.
