Performance is at 25
- Images too heavy, too many images in non next-gen formats.
- 3.45s of loading just because of the unused javascript
- a third party code blocked the main thread for 2,000ms it could be reduced
- enormous network payload could be reduced.
- the javascript execution time almost take 6s

Accessibility 88:
- The images do not have alt attributes 
- The links don't have discernible names (just like in both our pages so far)


Best Practices 83:
- Some missing source maps
- The unload event does not fire reliably and listening for it can prevent browser optimizations like the Back-Forward Cache.

SEO 79:
-Image elements no alt attributes
-Links not descriptive enough.
